Data Structure : 
ways to store and orgainize data effictively and efficiently 

- There are two types of data structure: 
1. Linear Data Structure : Store data sequentially 
2. Non-Linear Data Structure : 


Lv1: If it works , don't touch it 

Algorithm : 
is a step-by-step process of solving a specific coding problem 

Final Project : 
- vector , arrays 
-> Searching algorithm , Sort algorithm 


Why do we need to understand and analyze algorithm ? 
Because of constraints or resources 
Which case , we should use which algorithm 

- Some analogy 
Sacrifice simplicity for security 
Complexity for more security


### Assymtotic Notation  
There are different types of BIG O notation 
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(log n )
- O(n log n )
- O(n^2)
- O(n!)

5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
